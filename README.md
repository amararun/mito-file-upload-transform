**Try the deployed app [here](https://mito-script-generator-demo.streamlit.app/)**

Welcome to the **Python Script Generator Demo**! This app simplifies data manipulation by allowing you to interact with your data through an Excel-like interface while generating Python scripts based on your actions.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Manipulate your data using familiar spreadsheet functions.
- **Automatic Script Generation**: As you transform your data, the app records each step and generates the corresponding Python code.
- **CSV Export**: Download your cleaned data as a CSV file.

## Getting Started

1. **Import Your Data**: Upload your dataset into the app via Streamlit.
2. **Manipulate Your Data**: Use Mitosheet to clean and transform your data as needed.
3. **Download and Review**: Once youâ€™re finished, download your cleaned data as a CSV file and view the generated Python scripts for each transformation step.

## Why is this app useful?
**Streamlined Data Processing**: Quickly clean and transform data for analysis without needing extensive programming knowledge, making it accessible for non-developers.
